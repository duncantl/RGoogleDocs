Package: RGoogleDocs
Version: 0.6-0
Title:  Primitive interface to Google Documents from R
Description: This package provides an initial, elementary
 interface to Google's Document API for word processing and spreadsheet documents.
  One needs a Google login and password and then one
  can list, download, delete and upload documents
  to the Google account. There are facilities for
  accessing the contents of spreadsheets and 
  querying for elements such as images, links, comments and section titles
  of word processing documents.
Note:  There is now R documentation for the functions in the package.
  There is a brief "users guide" in inst/doc/run.pdf (and inst/doc/run.html).
  And the document inst/doc/basics.pdf gives more details about the low-level
  interaction with Google's API.
